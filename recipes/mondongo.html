    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2kg of pork</li>
        <li>6pods of red pepper</li>
        <li>6 to 8 peeled potatoes</li>
        <li>½ kg of corn mote (soaked)</li>
        <li>butter or oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of cumin</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>peppermint</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of yellow pepper</li>
        <li>½ kg of cooked pork rind</li>
        <li>1 chopped onion (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the ají colorado, starting with removing the seeds from the pods. Soak them in boiled water.</li>
        <li>If the corn mote is not cooked, boil it for at least one hour.</li>
        <li>Prepare the pork, cutting it into small pieces. Likewise, proceed like this with the cooked pork hides, at a very small size.</li>
        <li>Fry the pork using a saucepan.</li>
        <li>When the corn mote has reached the point of cooking, add the pieces of pork skin and cook for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the corn mote is cooking, use a pot and cook the dressing ingredients over low heat (the onion chopped into small cubes, the toothpick and a little salt). Add this preparation to the pot with the mote, and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Grind the chili in a blender or fulling machine, taking advantage of the water used for soaking. It should be foreseen that it is well ground and thick.</li>
        <li>Cook the potato in water with a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Using a saucepan, pour 3 tablespoons of oil, the ground red pepper, and season with a tablespoon of cumin. Add a glass of water and a pinch of salt. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes. Add the mint and the fried meats. Move the preparation and cook 15 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve the dish, starting with the mote and potatoes. Add a portion of pork, with its spicy broth. Finally decorate with a pinch of parsley.</li>
    </ol>
